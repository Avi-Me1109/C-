//Declaring but not intializing variables

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	//All variables have been declared here.
	float a, b, c, d, e;
	//values have been defined here as well.
	
	cout << "The first variable is: " << a << "\n";
	//Printing out the first variable that has been defined earlier.
	cout << "The second variable is: " << b << "\n";
	//Printing out the second variable.
	cout << "The third variable is: " << c << "\n";
	//Repeating the previous codes for the third, fourth and fifth values.
	cout << "The fourth variable is: " << d << "\n";
	cout << "The fifth variable is: " << e << "\n";
	
	//These lines of codes first defines the five variables while being declared in the first line as an 'int' type. 
	//Later random values are being printed by the cout command due to the lack of intiatilzation with a sentence and then the value itself.
	//The "/n" code creates newlines after each print for a cleaner output.
